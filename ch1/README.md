# Chapter 1 - First Concepts at baby Steps.

Create a folder with the name you wish and inside it create another folder (`mkdir ch1`) and access this folder (`cd ch1`).
This first folder is going to represent the first chapter of the book as well as the first Module in golang.
Every Golang project is a Module and will be in the future a code that will be converted into an executable code.

## Creating a Module in Golang

Inside the folder previously created, insert the following command at the terminal (`go mod init <module_name>`). You can name your module as you wish, but I named hello_world.
